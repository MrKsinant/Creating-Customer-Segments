# Creating Customer Segments

This study corresponds to the third project of the nanodegree *Machine Learning Engineer*, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to provide a machine learning model, using unsupervised learning, to create customer segments in a dataset belonging to a wholesale distributor. This dataset is based on a modified version of the dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).

In this repository, you will find the following files:
* The file ***creating-customer-segments.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The file ***visuals.py***, a Python file which contains functions allowing to visualize specific results obtained during the study;
* The file ***customers.csv***, the modified dataset used for this study.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the machine learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to **Scikit-Learn** (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a very popular and complete machine learning framework.
